the GENIA tagger uses the information extracted from the WORDNET. The NERsuite also 
requires the installation of libLBFGS (http://www.chokkan.org/software/liblbfgs/) 
and CRFsuite (http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/). Dictionary compiler and

And other collegues who willingly tested NERsuite and gave comments and advices


* History


Version 1.2.1 (2012.07.02)
	- Change: -multidoc [SEP] option for all programs now regards lines "beginning 
	            with" [SEP] as comment lines and print them without any modification,
	            whereas it previously dealt with the lines "exactly same" to [SEP].
	            In addition, multiple comment lines can be used from this version.
	
	- Change: nersuite_tokenizer computes token offsets at document level, whereas
	            it used sentence level token offsets. When it encounters a document
	            separator, which is given by -multidoc [SEP] option, the tokenizer
	            resets the offset to 0.
	
	- New function: correct_mp program which removes named entities having mismatched
	            parenthesis is added. Documentation will be added to the homepage
	            later.

Minor updates (2012.06.28)
	- Change: the standoff and brat output option now use unique IDs for entities 
	            regardless of their semantic types. The IDs are also counted in 
	            document level, whereas the conll option still counts it in sentence 
	            level.

	- Bug fix: a bug of the string normalization part of the dictionary compiler and 
	            tagger is fixed.
	
	- New function: brat format for output is added (by Sampo Pyysalo)
